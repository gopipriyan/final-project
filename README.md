House Sales Prediction

Overview

This project aims to predict house sales prices based on various features such as location, size, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, and other relevant attributes. The goal is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately forecast house sales prices, helping real estate agents, buyers, and sellers make informed decisions.

Model

The project uses a combination of feature engineering, data preprocessing, and machine learning algorithms to predict house sales prices. The following models are implemented:

Linear Regression
Decision Tree Regressor
Random Forest Regressor
Gradient Boosting Regressor
Evaluation Metrics

The performance of each model is evaluated using the following metrics:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
Mean Squared Error (MSE)
Root Mean Squared Percentage Error (RMSPE)
Results

The results of the project are presented in the form of a comparison of the performance of each model, along with visualizations of the predicted prices vs. actual prices.
